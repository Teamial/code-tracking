  <p>This is a personal project I used as an excuse to learn some Javascript. It's a to-do list made out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and using Vercel to host the site. There are 2 pages so far, a login page in the index and the homepage for the todo list (todo.html). I also made the clouds on the todo list home move across the screen like clouds and for the login page I used a video as the background. I used media queries for web responsiveness making the web app on device look better. </p>
